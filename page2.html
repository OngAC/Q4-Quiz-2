	<p>For Filipinos, they've probably heard or learned about the book <strong><em>Noli Me Tangere</em></strong> by <strong><em>Jose P. Rizal</em></strong>, their national hero. This book is known for its purpose, written by Rizal as a way of trying to educate the people of their poor situation under the rule of the Spaniards. It was a form of revolt through a book. For this reason, it is now a part of the Philippine education curriculum, providing a glimpse of how life was during those challenging times. The story revolves around a young and wealthy Filipino man who had recently returned to the Philippines after studying abroad and then faced the corrupt and controlling Spanish officials and privileged Filipinos. The main character in this book is named Crisostomo Ibarra, and his background is similar to Rizal's. The story effectively represents the societal issues of the past through different characters and events.</p>
